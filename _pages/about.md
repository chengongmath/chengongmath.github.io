I am currently a postdoc at Institute for Theoretical Sciences of Westlake University. I am in the research group of [JI Zhuchao](https://sites.google.com/site/zhuchaojishomepage/) (冀 诸超). Previously, I obtained my PhD degree from Institut Polytechnique de Paris under the supervision of [Charles FAVRE](https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/charles.favre/).

I am interested in complex and non-Archimedean dynamics. 

My CV is available [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
